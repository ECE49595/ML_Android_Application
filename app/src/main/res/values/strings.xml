        <item>Acer saccharum, the sugar maple, is a species of flowering plant in the soapberry and lychee family Sapindaceae. It is native to the hardwood forests of eastern Canada and eastern United States. Sugar maple is best known for being the primary source of maple syrup and for its brightly colored fall foliage. It may also be known as "rock maple", "sugar tree", "birds-eye maple", "sweet maple", "curly maple", or "hard maple", particularly when referring to the wood. It is a deciduous tree normally reaching heights of 80–115 ft, and exceptionally up to 150 ft. The tree is long-lived, typically 200 years and occasionally as much as 300.</item>
        <item>Acer rubrum, the red maple, also known as swamp maple, water maple, or soft maple, is one of the most common and widespread deciduous trees of eastern and central North America. The U.S. Forest Service recognizes it as the most abundant native tree in eastern North America. The red maple ranges from southeastern Manitoba around the Lake of the Woods on the border with Ontario and Minnesota, east to Newfoundland, south to Florida, and southwest to East Texas. At maturity, it often attains a height around 100 ft. Its flowers, petioles, twigs, and seeds are all red to varying degrees. Among these features, however, it is best known for its brilliant deep scarlet foliage in autumn.</item>
        <item>Prunus serotina, commonly called black cherry, wild black cherry, rum cherry, or mountain black cherry, is a deciduous tree or shrub of the genus Prunus. Despite being called black cherry, it is not very closely related to the commonly cultivated cherries such as sweet cherry, sour cherry and Japanese flowering cherries. The species is widespread and common in North America and South America.</item>
        <item>Fraxinus americana, the white ash or American ash, is a species of ash tree native to eastern and central North America. The species is native to mesophytic hardwood forests from Nova Scotia west to Minnesota, south to northern Florida, and southwest to eastern Texas. Isolated populations have also been found in western Texas, Wyoming, and Colorado, and the species is reportedly naturalized in Hawaii. White ash is one of the most used trees for everyday purposes and, to keep up with high demand, is cultivated almost everywhere possible. It is a traditional timber of choice for production of baseball bats, tool handles, furniture and flooring.</item>
        <item>Liriodendron tulipifera, the tulip tree, fiddletree, and yellow-poplar—is the tallest eastern hardwood. It is native to eastern North America and can grow to more than 160 ft in virgin cove forests of the Appalachian Mountains, often with no limbs until it reaches 80–100 ft in height, making it a very valuable timber tree. The tallest individual at the time of 2021 is called the Fork Ridge Tulip Tree at a secret location in the Great Smoky Mountains of North Carolina. It has been shown to be 191 feet 10 inches in height. This is the tallest known individual tree in eastern North America.</item>

        <item>Sugar maple is native to areas with cooler climates and requires a hard freeze each winter for proper dormancy. Seed germination also requires extremely low temperatures, the optimal being just slightly above freezing, and no other known tree species has this property. Germination of sugar maple seed in temperatures above 50 °F is rare to nonexistent.</item>
        <item>Over most of its range, red maple is adaptable to a very wide range of site conditions, perhaps more so than any other tree in eastern North America. It can be found growing in swamps, on poor, dry soils, and almost anywhere in between. It grows well from sea level to about 3,000 ft. Due to its attractive fall foliage and pleasing form, it is often used as a shade tree for landscapes. It is used commercially on a small scale for maple syrup production and for its medium to high quality lumber.</item>
        <item>Black cherry is a medium-sized, fast-growing forest tree growing to a height of 50–80 ft. The leaves are 2–5 inches long and oval in shape. Fall leaf color is yellow to red. Its flowers are small, white and 5-petalled, in racemes 4–6 inches long which contain several dozen flowers. The flowers give rise to reddish-black "berries" fed on by birds. An almond-like odor is released when a young twig is scratched, revealing minute amounts of cyanide compounds produced and stored by the plant as a defense mechanism against herbivores.</item>
        <item>The emerald ash borer beetle threatens 7.5 billion ash trees in the United States and the entire North American genus Fraxinus. Since its accidental introduction into the United States and Canada in the 1990s, and its subsequent detection in 2002, it has spread to eleven states and adjacent parts of Canada.</item>
        <item>It is fast-growing, without the common problems of weak wood strength and short lifespan often seen in fast-growing species. April marks the start of the flowering period in the Southern United States; trees at the northern limit of cultivation begin to flower in June. The flowers are pale green or yellow (rarely white), with an orange band on the tepals; they yield large quantities of nectar. The tulip tree is the state tree of Indiana, Kentucky, and Tennessee.</item>
